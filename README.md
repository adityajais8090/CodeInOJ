2. **Main Platform Service**:  
   - Manages user authentication, problem listings, and leaderboards.  

### Security  
- **DDoS Protection**: Prevent botnet attacks.  
- **Sandboxing**: Execute code in isolated environments to prevent malicious scripts.  
- **Execution Limits**: Enforce time and resource limits for code execution.
